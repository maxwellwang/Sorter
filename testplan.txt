We tested the following to catch human error:
* Incorrect number of arguments or wrong arguments (invalid filename/invalid sort) to ensure that the correct errors would be thrown and the program would terminate.
** "./a.out", "./a.out -q", "./a.out somefile", "./a.out -f somefile", "./a.out -q invalidfile", etc
* All types of whitespaces (space, \t, \n, \r, etc) in all places: before tokens, inside tokens, after tokens. For example, a single token could be split over several newlines and spaces. For example:
Start of somefile:
te


s          t


i n



g

,
,


End of somefile
A correct parse would return the words "testing", and "", which it does.

We tested the following to catch system IO errors:
* A very large file to ensure the IO loop reads the entire file without fail.
* A very large file to ensure if read() splits a token, we still parse it correctly.
* Files with back to back delimiters (so two commas) to ensure we parse it correctly as a valid token: ",,," would be three empty tokens.


We tested the following (independently) to test the comparator functions:
* For strings, empty strings, identical strings, a string and a substring of that string, different strings. So comparing ("", "a"), ("test", "te"), ("tes", "tes"), ("test","z"), etc.
* For integers: zero, negative numbers, the same number, numbers of opposite magnitude, different numbers, randomly chosen numbers. For example: (1,1), (1,-1),(0,-1), etc.


We tested the following to verify the sorting functions:
* Duplicate/n-plicates, lists in sorted order, sorted order but reversed, randomly generated lists, etc. For example (5,4,3,2,1), (1,2,3,4,5), (1,1,1,1,1) for ints and ("a","b","c"), ("c","b","a"), etc.
* Very small lists with less than 5 items to ensure edge cases worked properly.
* Compared by sight but also ran quicksort and insertion sort against each other to verify for larger files.


We tested the following to verify integration of sorting, comparator, and IO:
* Python script to randomly populate and generate test files, which then calls our program and compares the output.


We tested the following to verify we free()’d everything:
* Using Valgrind.
